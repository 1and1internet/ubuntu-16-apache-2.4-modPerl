# You can put your own apache config in this directory and it will be invoked the next time you restart this server.
# This allows you to create your own mod_perl handlers.
# 
# You can also modify any of the existing files in this directory. 
# To revert to the default version of a file, delete it and restart your server.
# 
# If you make a mistake in your config then apache will not start on next reboot.
# Instead, an 'emergency' apache site will be deployed advising you to investigate the error logs for details.
